* This package is intended for use by cosmologists doing analysis of 
the large-scale structure of the universe. If you do not work in the field, 
please forgive the use of jargon ...
=========================================================
PURPOSE

The purpose of this package 
is to provide the 
full 2d joint-likelihood posterior 
of cz/H/r_s and Da/r_s at z=0.57 from 
analysis of the anisotropic clustering 
of the BOSS DR9 CMASS galaxies. 
As these likelihoods are model independent, 
they are useful for combining with other data sets 
to constrain cosmology. 
We provide all results both pre- and post-reconstruction 
of the baryonic acoustic feature. 

*We recommend using the full likelihood profile 
for analysis, and 
not a Gaussian approximation, 
as the former is not Gaussian at the 
2sigma level*

As described below, the user can either 
use the likelihood function directly, 
or through a short easy-to-use 
python module provided. 

Alternatively, we provide the correlation functions, 
covariance matrices and their inverse used in this analysis. 
=========================================================
DISCLAIMER

These results are pending peer review through the MNRAS

REFERENCE & CREDIT

Reference for details and credit of usage should be to: Kazin, Sanchez et al. (2013; submitted)

There is also an option to use the BOSS consensus result (see below), 
in this case credit is to: Anderson et al. (2013; submitted)

Created by: Eyal Kazin, Swinburne University of Technology; March 15th 2013; eyalkazin@gmail.com
	    Antonio Cuesta (Yale) and Xiaoying Xu (Carnegie Mellon University) assisted in producing the consensus product.

CONTENT

This package contains:
(1) Likelihood profiles of cz/H/r_s and Da/r_s as well as example code to call the files
(2) Correlation function (clustering wedges; multipoles*)
(3) Covariance matrices and their inverse

* multipoles results are as used in Kazin, Sanchez et al. (2013), 
not Anderson et al. (2013). The latter can be found at:
http://www.sdss3.org/science/boss_publications.php

*The clustering wedges were used in both studies.
The pre-reconstruction clustering wedges are also similar to those used in Sanchez, Kazin et al. (2013), 
although at a slightly narrower range of analysis. 
=========================================================
NOTATION

z =  the redshift; for BOSS CMASS DR9 use z=0.57
H =  Hubble expansion at z;  H=da/dt/a where a=1/(1+z) is the expansion factor
Da = the proper (physical) angular diameter distance to redshift z
r_s= the comoving sound horizon at the end of the drag era z_d. 
c  = the speed of light  299792.458 km/s
Note that cz/H/r_s and Da/r_s are unitless
=========================================================
LIKELIHOOD PROFILES

The 2D likelihood 
profiles of cz/H/r_s and Da/r_s 
are in the folder ``CMASSDR9_KazinSanchez_hrsdars_likelihood/likelihood_functions/":

The pre-reconstruction result is:
HzDaprofile_rpt_wedges_preRec_T0.15.txt

The post-reconstruction is:
HzDaprofile_rpt_wedges_postRec_T0.15.txt 

Both of these are produced by running MCMC chains using the RPT-based template, 
and assuming a flat prior of |epsilon|<0.15. 

We provide a third result:
HzDaprofile_dewiggled_consensus_postRec_T0.15.txt

This last consensus profile is produced by combining post-reconstruction results from 
analysis of clustering wedges and multipoles using the dewiggled template, 
as described in Anderson et al. (2013; submitted). 

For example usage see "EXAMPLE USAGE" below.
=========================================================
CORRELATION FUNCTIONS AND COVARIANCES

Can be found in the ``CMASSDR9_KazinSanchez_xi/" folder. 
We yield the option to use the clustering wedges or the multipoles. 
We yield the option to use results before and after reconstruction. 
In each sub folder are four files, where the one that ends with .cove 
includes the covariance matrix and its inverse.
The files ending with .xi yields the correlation functions and their rms. 
See headers of the files for details.


* multipoles results are as used in Kazin, Sanchez et al. (2013), 
not Anderson et al. (2013). The latter can be found at:
http://www.sdss3.org/science/boss_publications.php

*The clustering wedges were used in both studies. 
The pre-reconstruction clustering wedges are also similar to those used in Sanchez, Kazin et al. (2013), 
although at a slightly narrower range of analysis. 
=========================================================
EXAMPLE USAGE

We provide python code for usage of the Likelihood profiles.
The main file to use is 
hrsdars_likelihood.py. 
See its header for full details.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Python Packages used:
Essential:
numpy
scipy.interpolate
sys
os

Recommended:
matplotlib.pyplot
pickle
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ IMPORTANT! ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Once the modules are imported, 
the only setup required is 
modifying in hrsdars_likelihood.py the 
dir_main Argument
to the directory of hrsdars_likelihood.py.
---------------------
QUICK USAGE

at the command line do:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
python example_usage.py
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For modifications and understanding how the 
open up example_usage.py 
to see how to toggle reconstruction 
from "post" (with reconstruction)
to "pre"    (without reconstruction)
Also vary consensus from True to False for usage of the post-reconstruction consensus result.

The output should look something like the plotted in 
the file example_profile.tiff.
